# **Starbucks-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis**
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Starbucks customer data, focusing on understanding customer behavior and preferences. The analysis utilizes the Starbucks Customer Data dataset from Kaggle and employs advanced data analysis techniques, culminating in the application of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering for customer segmentation.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes information on customer demographics, transaction details, and interactions with Starbucks' promotional offers. It provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior and allows for meaningful insights into Starbucks' customer base.

## **Analysis Highlights**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

 - A thorough exploration of customer demographics and transaction patterns.
 - Examination of the effectiveness of Starbucks' promotional offers.

2. Customer Segmentation with KNN:

 - Utilization of KNN clustering to segment customers based on their behavior.
 - Interpretation of the distinct characteristics of each customer segment.

## **Cluster Analysis Summary:**

**Valuable Customers - Cluster 1**: Customers in this cluster consistently respond positively to offers, displaying a high rate of offer views and completions. Although they don't make the most purchases (around 12 per month), their spending surpasses all other clusters, with an impressive Average Purchase Value of $18.2. Notably, high-spending outliers also align with this cluster. Recommendation: The company should prioritize retaining and encouraging more purchases from these high-value customers.

**Regular Patrons - Cluster 3**: Customers in this cluster make frequent purchases, averaging more than one every two days, establishing them as regular patrons. Despite viewing and completing offers around the overall average, their total spending is slightly below average due to a lower Average Purchase Value of $4.2. Suggestion: As loyal customers who purchase with or without offers, efforts should focus on increasing their Average Purchase Value, possibly through enticing them with discounted or free trials of higher-priced products.

**Potential High-Value Customers - Cluster 4**: With the second-highest Average Purchase Value at $18.1, these customers exhibit a strong response to offers, viewing most and completing 70%. Customization: Leveraging their sensitivity to offers, the company should target them with more offers to boost their purchase frequency, potentially elevating them to Most Valuable Customers.

**Offer Explorers - Cluster 2**: This cluster displays a keen interest in offer viewing (4.5) but completes fewer offers (1.5) with a moderate Average Purchase Value of $11.1. Customization: To engage these customers more effectively, the company should tailor offers with attractive deals across a variety of products to encourage habitual purchasing.

**Low-Engagement Segment - Cluster 0**: Despite receiving a similar number of offers, customers in this cluster exhibit low engagement across all features, resulting in a low Average Purchase Value of $6.9. Customization: Addressing the low engagement of these customers will require strategic efforts, considering factors such as brand loyalty or the lack of a purchasing habit. The company should invest resources if a change in engagement is desired.
